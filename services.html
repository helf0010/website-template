Google is a popular search engine that has, in recent months, implemented an AI Overview system to summarize their results. The overview is often comprised of incorrect information from unreliable sources, and the AI system used to create it is contributing significantly to climate change. This is because AI systems run through thousands of bits of programming, trying to create the best possible result to answer your inquiry, causing the physical systems to overheat. The way companies cool their AI systems is by using water. An unbelievable amount of water. Water we could be using to drink, or maybe to PUT OUT FIRES IN LA <a href="#footnote-1" title="Read footnote."><sup>1</sup></a>? Hmm.

<sup>1</sup>The fires in LA have currently completely destroyed many people's homes, and the known death toll has risen to 25. California has been experiencing extreme drought conditions for several years now. The water wasted on cooling AI systems could be used to aid in their crisis.
